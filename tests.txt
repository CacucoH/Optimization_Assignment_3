Enter the supply coefficients: 70 50
Enter the number of demand locations: 3
Enter the cost matrix row by row:
Enter costs for supply 1: 4 6 8
Enter costs for supply 2: 5 4 3
Enter the demand coefficients: 40 60 20

Initial problem:
Supply\Demand  40        60        20        
Supply 1       4         6         8         
Supply 2       5         4         3         

Solution:
[40, 30, 0]
[0, 30, 20]

Total cost: 
4 * 40 + 6 * 30 + 4 * 30 + 3 * 20 = 520
