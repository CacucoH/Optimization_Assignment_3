# Assignment 3
Write a computer program in any programming language (e.g. Python, C++) to find initial
basic feasible solution for given transportation problem by using
(a) North-West corner method,
(b) Vogel’s approximation method,
(c) Russell’s approximation method.

# Solution
The final version of a program `combined_version.py` solves a problem using 3 methods requested by the task and prints all necessary information.

In case of problem invalidity returns:
- ”The method is not applicable!” - If, for example, costs matrix contains value <= 0
- ”The problem is not balanced!” - If problem is unbalanced
